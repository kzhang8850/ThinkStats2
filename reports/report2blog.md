##### Introduction:
*Question introduction about terrorism and whether or not it's region specific*

##### Methodology:

*Talk about database*

*Talk about the variables found and why you believe these variables are sufficient to prove the question*

*How did you actually go about answering the question, what methods used, etc.*

For a deeper dive into the source code, check out my [ipython notebook](https://github.com/kzhang8850/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/report2.ipynb).

##### Results and Interpretations:

*begin with opening statement about analysis, broad sweep*

*Figure 1:*


*talk about the regression, what it means, what the relevant parts mean, like r-square, coefficient, p-values, etc.*

*transition to RMSE*

|RMSE without model | RMSE with model | Improvement from model |
| 11.42  | 11.27| 0.15|


*Figure 2: *

*talk about the figure 2, what it means for the question*

*transition to the other part of the "question"*

 *Figure 3: *

*talk about the wounded regression, what the relevant parts mean, what it means for the question*

*transition to RMSE*

| 22.72  | 22.61 | 0.11|


*Figure 4: *

*Discuss the table and what it means in terms of the question*

*end with a beautiful statement conclusion*


##### Limitations and Next Steps:

Evidently there are some shortcomings of the model and the data I chose to use.

Some next steps

In any case, I believe this is a compelling statement that
