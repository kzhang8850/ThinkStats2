# Sungwoo Park - Is Terms of Home Mortgage Less Favorable Now Compared to That of Pre-subprime Mortgage Crisis in 2007?
## by Kevin Zhang
## Data Science 4/25/2017

The primary motivating question of this report is whether it is plausible to assume that contemporary home mortgages are much harder to get and much more conservative than those of pre-2007 mortgages. The author is trying to see whether the 2007-2008 financial crisis had any impact on the confidence of lenders in home mortgages, more specifically whether lenders are less confident and giving less favorable loans to potential borrowers.


The dataset used is a database containing all home mortgages purchased or guaranteed between 1999-2016, created by The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, more commonly known as Freddie Mac. The database contains multiple variables for each mortgage, including interest rate, loan to value ratio, and others. Given that the database came from under the direction of the US federal government, I would think it's quite credible.

The author currently has an incomplete report. As of 4/25/2017, the report on github only contains a framing of the question, some methodology, and then a presentation of some visualizations. The author currently has just performed regression analysis on the question of interest, and has presented the results in raw format, without much additional explanation or interpretation of what the regression analysis means.


The analysis provided by the author as of this moment is not enough to answer the question. The presentation of the regression analysis without much additional explanation is unfortunately not enough information for the reader to make any sense of the report. After talking with the author, it does appear that the regression analysis is hinting towards a potential answer in that it appears that the favorability of a mortgage is not dependent on the financial crisis, or that interest rate is not affected by the economic fluctuations, as the 2006 and 2015 regressions show little change over time. But again, this is based on what was heard from the author, as there is not enough written material to make a conclusion.


I think the article has the potential to be interesting, as house mortgages are an interesting concept to many potential house hunters/owners, and having some insight into the trends that mortgages follow would be of value to people. The report itself is not currently very engaging, mainly stymied by the fact that it isn't complete. Looking at the report itself as of April 25th, it is definitely lacking some substance and needs more content to make it more compelling.

Some suggestions based on what information I can garner from the framework and the regression analysis:

- I think a bit more background information should be given about home mortgages, as personally I know very little about mortgages, so it took me a while to understand what I was reading. I think that the explanation on the relevance of the financial crisis in the situation was well explained, but I'm not sure if all readers have a deep enough understanding of what house mortgages are to be able to make sense of the question. Perhaps a brief crash course on how house mortgages work and how they are affected by a couple factors might help readers more easily transition into the question and the methodology.
- Make sure to really clearly state the question. There was a pass on the main topic of the report in the form of an assumption, but when the last sentence of the paragraph is "I attempt to answer the above question", and I don't see a question, that creates a disruption in flow.
- The Methodology portion was very well done. I like the clearly laid out framework of how the question is to be defined for the purposes of the report and how the question was to be evaluated based on what was found in the data through analysis. Maybe consider expanding upon it slightly to help readers better comprehend the dataset. For example, you pass around a lot of terms like loan to value ratio, or unpaid principal balance, and you do give links to learn more, but when there are so many unknowns, perhaps it might be better to give some more in-line context in the report. In addition, after talking with the author, is appears that the interest rate is meant to be what is evaluated, and is not the evaluator. It would be nice to make the clarification that interest rate is being defined as the favorability of the mortgage, and that the goal is to see what affects interest rate.
- After talking with the author, it appears that the transition between the methodology and the result and interpretation makes a lot of sense. The author makes it clear that the definition of a favorable mortgage is based on its interest rate, and thus the goal is to see what changes the interest rate and what factors influence it. He then presents regression analysis to achieve his goal. However, I'm not convinced that regression is necessarily the way to go in this instance, as it appears there is a disconnect between the framing of the question and the analysis. For example, the author explained in the regression models he presented that it appears that credit score's influence on interest rate didn't really change much as a result of the financial crisis. But I have difficulty seeing the link between what that means and how it answers the original question. Consider using a different regression model or a different tool altogether, such as maybe time series, or machine learning. Reframing the question might also be useful depending on what your exact goal is.
- Finally, this will probably come as the report is written out, but do make sure to fully explain your your results and conclusions. House mortgages, from what I understand, are not as easy to comprehend as facebook posts or weather, which are much more intuitive to people. It is critical when dealing with a particularly complicated subject to make sure the audience understands what is going on at each step of the process towards answering the question.

Regarding professionalism, the presentation is once again, incomplete, so it's hard to say. I would say that the presentation is relatively professional, given its very "first draft" state. Spelling and grammar could use some work, but the meaning was still very clear and easy to understand. The formatting of the report is quite concise and well done, as it is apparent that the author knows what he needs to write about and has a good sense of organization and flow. All he needs to do now is flush out the report and complete it, and then I'm sure it'll more compelling and engaging.
