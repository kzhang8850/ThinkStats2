# Sungwoo Park - Is Terms of Home Mortgage Less Favorable Now Compared to That of Pre-subprime Mortgage Crisis in 2007?
## by Kevin Zhang
## Data Science 4/25/2017

The primary motivating question of this report is whether it is plausible to assume that contemporary home mortgages are much harder to get and much more conservative than those of pre-2007 mortgages. The author is trying to see whether the 2007-2008 financial crisis had any impact on the confidence of lenders in home mortgages, more specifically whether lenders are less confident and giving less favorable loans to potential borrowers.


The dataset used is a database containing all home mortgages purchased or guaranteed between 1999-2016, created by The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, more commonly known as Freddie Mac. The database contains multiple variables for each mortgage, including interest rate, loan to value ratio, and others. Given that the database came from under the direction of the US federal government, I would think it's quite credible.

The author currently has an incomplete report. As of this moment, the report on github only contains a framing of the question, some methodology, and then a presentation of some visualizations. The author currently has just performed regression analysis on the question of interest, and has presented the results in raw format, without much additional explanation of interpretation of what the regression analysis means.


The analysis provided by the author as of this moment is not enough to answer the question. The presentation of the regression analysis without much additional explanation is unfortunately not enough information for the reader to make any sense of the article. After much thought, it seems that the regression do not even have a tie to the original question, although it's hard to tell because there isn't much detail as to what message the regression analysis is actually trying to give as of right now.


I think the article has the potential to be interesting, as house mortgages is an interesting concept to many potential house hunters/owners, and maybe having some insight into the trends that mortgages follow would be of value to people. The article itself is not currently very engaging, mainly stymied by the fact that it very clearly isn't complete. Looking at the report in and of itself as of April 25th, it is definitely lacking some substance and content to make it more compelling.

Some suggestions based on what information I can garner from the framework and the regression:

- I think some a bit more background information should be given about the home mortgages and the subprime mortgages part, as personally I know very little about mortgages, so it took me a while to understand what I was reading. Also, I'm not sure how subprime mortgages really tie into the report, or whether they're just meant to be there to explain the 2007-2008 crash.
- Make sure to really clearly state the question. There was a pass by on the main topic of the report as an assumption, but when the last sentence of the paragraph is "I attempt to answer the above question", and I don't see a question, that brings up some question marks and creates a disruption in flow.
- The Methodology portion was very well done. I like the clearly laid out framework of how the question is to be defined for the purposes of the report and how the question was to be evaluated based on what was found in the data through analysis. This section honestly was the reason why I could understand your report. Maybe consider expanding upon it slightly to help readers better comprehend what it is you're really searching for. For example, you pass around a lot of terms like loan to value ratio, or unpaid principal balance, and you do give links to learn more, but when there are so many unknowns, perhaps it might be better to give some more context in the report.
- I become very confused between the Methodology and the regression analysis presented. The Methodology framed the question as looking into looking at interest rate as the evaluation of whether a mortgage was considered favorable. But then the regression analysis is performed on the interest rate as a dependent variable, which makes it seem like you're trying to look for something that predicts interest rate. If that is indeed what you're trying to do, then consider re-framing your methodology. If you're still trying to look at interest rate as the cause of loan favorability, then consider using a different regression model or a different tool altogether, such as maybe time series, or machine learning.
- Finally, this will probably come as the report is more flushed out, but do make sure to fully explain your framing of the question, your context, your results, and your conclusions. House mortgages, from what I understand, are not as easy to comprehend as facebook posts or weather, which are much more intuitive to people. It is critical when dealing with a particularly complicated subject to make sure the audience understand what is going on at each step of the process of answering the question.

The presentation is once again, incomplete, so it's hard to say. I would say that the presentation is relatively professional, given its very "first draft" state. Spelling and grammar could use some work, as it is clear a proofread was probably not given before submission. The formatting of the report is quite clear and well done, as it is apparent that the author knows what he needs to write about and has a good sense of organization and flow. All he needs to do now is flush out the report and complete it, and then I'm sure it'll be a lot better.
