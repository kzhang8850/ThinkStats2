# Abstract

In the political arena, liberals often call their conservative counterparts "ignorant" because they believe that the other party doesn't know the facts, that they just don't know what's going on in the world. This would suggest that being more informed on political news and current events would make one more liberal. But does it really matter though? Does being more informed about politics make a person more liberal? Does it matter at all on how people end up voting? This article will decide whether being an informed individual truly results in believing a more liberal platform, or whether this notion is just a mislead stereotype meant as a mudsling tactic.

Data analytics show that apparently a person has a high chance of holding the same opinion regardless of whether they are informed individuals or not. However, it seems that rather than leaning towards liberals, being more informed has the potential to make people more polarized towards either side and have stronger opinions on various political topics in general. While being more informed might not lead an increase in liberal thoughts, it might very well make people better able to cast a more thoughtful and representative vote.
