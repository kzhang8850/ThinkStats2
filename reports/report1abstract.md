# Abstract

People always encourage others to be an informed voter, to keep up with current affairs and political news. Some Democrats even hint that the lack of information is what keeps Republicans conservative. A popular stereotype is that the informed individual, because they know more thing about the world, would be more liberal because facts generally point towards a more progressive standpoint. But does it really matter though? Does being more informed about politics make a person more liberal? Does it matter at all on how people end up voting? This article aims to answer these questions.

Results show that apparently a person has a high chance of making the same decision on holding the same opinion regardless of whether they are informed individuals or not. It seems that it's very possible for more informed people to hold conservative views on progressive topics and vice versa, although there do seem to be hints of additional polarity due to an increase in information. Being a liberal doesn't have a whole lot to do with being informed. Bummer.
