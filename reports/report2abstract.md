# Abstract

With Trump's recent travel ban and the escalation of threats and controversial actions against people of associated with the Middle East, there has been a rise of fear and paranoia around the Middle East region of the possibility of a terrorist attack. But is there is a reason to be so afraid of the Middle East and its affiliated citizens? What is the chance that you would die to your next door neighbor who is from Saudi Arabia who could "potentially" be a terrorist? This article attempts to answer that question, as well as also seeing what that chance might be in the Middle East itself.

Results that while the probability of being affected by terrorism in the Middle East is indeed higher than that of North America, the value itself is still ridiculously small, to the point of being negligible. The data suggests that people's fears are unfounded and that to discriminate against Middle East citizens because of a 1 in 15 million chance is irrational.
