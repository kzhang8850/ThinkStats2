# Abstract

With Trump's recent travel ban and the escalation of controversial actions against Middle Eastern people, there has been a rise of paranoia towards the Middle East region for fear of the possibility of a terrorist attack. But is there is a reason to be so afraid of the Middle East, or even terrorism in general? What is the chance that an American would be a victim to terrorism?

Results show that the chance of a person being affected by terrorism in the North American region is almost 0, especially when compared to the probability in the Middle East itself. The data suggests that people's fears are unfounded and that the controversial reactions towards Middle East citizens because of a 1 in 15 million chance are irrational.
